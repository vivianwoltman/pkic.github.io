Other standards documents such as the ISO/IEC 9594-8/ITU-T Recommendation X.509, “Information Technology – Open Systems Interconnection: The Directory: Authentication Framework” and the American Bar Association’s Digital Signature Guidelines: Legal Infrastructure for Certification Authorities and Electronic Commerce suggested a framework for compliance by CAs, including establishment of a detailed and public Certification Practice Statement (CPS) with security procedures the CA would be obliged to follow. See <a href=http://www.americanbar.org/groups/science_technology/digital_signatures.html>http://www.americanbar.org/groups/science_technology/digital_signatures.html</a>.

Originally there was only an ETSI Technical Standard (TS) for issuing qualified certificates under the European Electronic Signature Directive 1999/93/EC (TS 101 456). However, there are now ETSI Technical Standards comparable to WebTrust, such as TS 102 042: Policy requirements for certification authorities issuing public key certificates. As of this writing, these ETSI Technical Standards are progressing through the European Commission to become European Norms (EN) under EN 319 411.

See <a href=http://www.cabforum.org/>www.cabforum.org</a>. In 2007 the Forum released standards and requirements defining a higher-security Extended Validation (EV) certificate with stronger customer authentication under the EV Guidelines. See <a href=https://www.cabforum.org/documents.html>https://www.cabforum.org/documents.html</a>. This, in turn, led to auditable WebTrust and ETSI criteria in 2007 for all CAs that issue EV certificates, so that most CAs had to successfully complete <em><strong>two</strong></em> sets audit criteria each year.</p><p>Successful CAs are either permitted to display an additional EV WebTrust seal on their websites (see figure below) or be listed as successfully completing an audit under ETSI TR 101 564 (Guidance on ETSI TS 102 042 for Issuing Extended Validation Certificates for Auditors and CSPs).</p><figure><img src=/uploads/2013/10/webtrust-cert-auth-extended.jpg></figure><p>Finally, the Forum decided to create additional auditable standards that would apply to all publicly trusted SSL certificates issued by a CA, not just EV certificates, and to beef up system security requirements at the same time. This led to the new CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements (2012) and related Baseline Requirements for WebTrust and ETSI (2013). Commercial CAs now must meet at least <em><strong>three</strong></em> sets of audit criteria covering their security, operations, and procedures each year.</p><h3 id=browser-root-program-requirements>Browser Root Program Requirements <a class=header-link href=#browser-root-program-requirements><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" fill="currentcolor" class="bi bi-link-45deg" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path d="M4.715 6.542 3.343 7.914a3 3 0 104.243 4.243l1.828-1.829A3 3 0 008.586 5.5L8 6.086a1.001 1.001.0 00-.154.199 2 2 0 01.861 3.337L6.88 11.45A2 2 0 114.05 8.62l.793-.792a4.018 4.018.0 01-.128-1.287z"/><path d="M6.586 4.672A3 3 0 007.414 9.5l.775-.776a2 2 0 01-.896-3.346L9.12 3.55a2 2 0 012.83 2.83l-.793.792c.112.42.155.855.128 1.287l1.372-1.372A3 3 0 008.414 2.844L6.586 4.672z"/></svg></a></h3><p>But who actually forces commercial CAs to successfully complete these three WebTrust / ETSI annual audits? The browsers and operating systems that accept and trust “roots” from CAs and include them in their software updates, such as Microsoft, Mozilla, Google, Apple, and Opera. CAs can only sell digital certificates to customers if their roots are accepted as trusted by the browsers and operating systems and included in their software, so the browsers are in a position to force all CAs to complete these annual audits.</p><p>For examples of browser root programs that all CAs must satisfy, see:</p><ul><li>Microsoft: <a href=http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/3281.introduction-to-the-microsoft-root-certificate-program.aspx>http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/3281.introduction-to-the-microsoft-root-certificate-program.aspx</a></li><li>Mozilla: <a href=http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/policy/>http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/policy/</a></li><li>Google: <a href=https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security/root-ca-policy>https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security/root-ca-policy</a></li><li>Apple: <a href=http://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/ca_program.html>http://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/ca_program.html</a></li><li>Opera: <a href=http://www.opera.com/docs/ca/>http://www.opera.com/docs/ca/</a></li></ul><p>Browsers require proof of annual WebTrust or ETSI audits, as well as compliance with all other program rules, and additional requirements are added by the browsers frequently as new security needs are identified. CAs that don’t comply can (and do) have their roots removed from the browser root stores, which is effectively a death sentence for the CA’s business (as its certificates will no longer be trusted by the public).</p><p>Diginotar is one example of a CA that went out of business, in large part because its root certificates were no longer trusted after browsers had removed them from trusted root stores in their browser software.
