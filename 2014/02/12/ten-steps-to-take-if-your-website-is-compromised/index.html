These have become standard responses to news of this sort. In much the same way, there are some common actions that you should be aware of if your website becomes compromised.</p><p>Many millions of websites are compromised and infected with various forms of malware every year. By one account, more than 10,000 sites are blacklisted by Google every day, meaning that a warning stating “this site may harm your computer” or “this site may be hacked” is displayed when it comes up in a Google search. If this happens to your website, recovery is likely to be your urgent priority, especially if significant customers or revenue are generated by the site. Unfortunately, the recovery process is complex and may take some time. Here we’ll give you an overview and in some cases recommend tools that can help you, but you should also consider engaging a professional.</p><h2 id=verify-the-compromise>Verify the Compromise <a class=header-link href=#verify-the-compromise><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" fill="currentcolor" class="bi bi-link-45deg" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path d="M4.715 6.542 3.343 7.914a3 3 0 104.243 4.243l1.828-1.829A3 3 0 008.586 5.5L8 6.086a1.001 1.001.0 00-.154.199 2 2 0 01.861 3.337L6.88 11.45A2 2 0 114.05 8.62l.793-.792a4.018 4.018.0 01-.128-1.287z"/><path d="M6.586 4.672A3 3 0 007.414 9.5l.775-.776a2 2 0 01-.896-3.346L9.12 3.55a2 2 0 012.83 2.83l-.793.792c.112.42.155.855.128 1.287l1.372-1.372a3 3 0 00-4.243-4.243L6.586 4.672z"/></svg></a></h2><p>This step may seem obvious, but today’s malware may not be discovered just by visiting the site because the longer it goes undetected, the more damage it can inflict. Moreover, simply visiting the site to look for malware is possibly the worst thing you can do because you’ll expose your PC to the infection!</p><p>If you suspect a compromise, you should check to see if you’re on the Google blacklist. An easy way to do this is to perform a search for your site and look for the telltale warning in the search results as shown below. Another approach is to use <a href=http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/%E2%80%8E>Google Search Console</a>.</p><figure><img src=/uploads/2014/02/what-to-do-if-your-site-is-compromised.jpg></figure><p>In many cases, your hosting provider can help. You should contact them immediately. A more comprehensive approach is to use a website malware scanner. Similar to a desktop virus scanner, these tools will search your site for malware. The best of these tools will require access to the files on your site via FTP so that source code can be scanned.</p><h2 id=quarantine-the-site-and-change-passwords>Quarantine the Site and Change Passwords <a class=header-link href=#quarantine-the-site-and-change-passwords><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" fill="currentcolor" class="bi bi-link-45deg" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path d="M4.715 6.542 3.343 7.914a3 3 0 104.243 4.243l1.828-1.829A3 3 0 008.586 5.5L8 6.086a1.001 1.001.0 00-.154.199 2 2 0 01.861 3.337L6.88 11.45A2 2 0 114.05 8.62l.793-.792a4.018 4.018.0 01-.128-1.287z"/><path d="M6.586 4.672A3 3 0 007.414 9.5l.775-.776a2 2 0 01-.896-3.346L9.12 3.55a2 2 0 012.83 2.83l-.793.792c.112.42.155.855.128 1.287l1.372-1.372a3 3 0 00-4.243-4.243L6.586 4.672z"/></svg></a></h2><p>As soon as you determine that your site is infected, you should consider taking it offline until you can clean it up.

If you collect any type of information from your visitors, you should find out if you have any legal obligations and consider consulting an attorney.</p><p>This is also a good time to determine if you have a recent backup of your site. Even if you do have a recent backup, consider making another current copy of your compromised site and associated log files. This may be useful in determining the source of the infection or exactly what data may have been taken.

This means that your encryption keys need to be replaced to ensure that others can’t intercept your communications. The most common of these keys are the ones used by SSL. Most Certificate Authorities offer a free service that will “reissue” or “rekey” your certificate using a new key pair that you provide via a Certificate Signing Request (CSR). You might also use client certificates for website authentication or keys for SSH access to you site.
