Gogo provides Wi-Fi capabilities to airline passengers. Gogo likes to control the bandwidth and wants to stop passengers from downloading large files such as movies; however, Gogo cannot tell what the content is for encrypted traffic. As such, Gogo intercepts the traffic using their own MitM server, which decrypts the traffic and then bandwidth controls can be used. Their certificate is untrusted, which makes the passenger accept a session with an error. This is not a best practice to train users to accept errors.</p><p><a href=https://casecurity.org/2015/02/20/lenovo-enables-man-in-the-middle-attacks-via-superfish-adware/>Lenovo provided the MitM vulnerability on its PCs</a>. They used an application called Superfish to enable their adware application to deliver content transparently. Where the session is encrypted, Superfish issues a certificate to MitM the session. The certificate is trusted, because the root certificate was installed on the PC before shipping from Lenovo. To add to the vulnerability, all root certificates use the same private key, which is also bundled onto the PC. The private key was easily hacked, which would allow attackers to sign certificates which many Lenovo users would trust.</p><p>It was also discovered <a href=https://threatpost.com/privdog-poses-bigger-risk-than-superfish/111211/>PrivDog may pose a bigger risk than Superfish</a>. PrivDog also supports MitM for adware, but in the PrivDog case, it does not validate the site certificate. As such the browser user may connect to a site with an untrusted certificate.</p><p><a href=https://casecurity.org/2015/04/02/fighting-the-good-fight-for-online-trust/>CNNIC mistakenly issued a certification authority (CA) certificate</a> to a customer. As such the private key could be used to issue certificates which would be trusted for most browsers. Again, this type of certificate could be used for a MitM attack. Due to the actions of CNNIC, Google decided that Chrome would not trust any new certificates unless they were logged with Certificate Transparency. Mozilla took a tougher action, as Firefox now distrusts CNNIC certificates issued after April 1, 2015.</p><p>In November, it was discovered that <a href=http://en.community.dell.com/dell-blogs/direct2dell/b/direct2dell/archive/2015/11/23/response-to-concerns-regarding-edellroot-certificate>Dell had installed two root certificates on its PCs</a>, including the private key. These roots were installed in Windows and would be trusted by all applications using Windows for security. Again, there was an opportunity to attack the private keys and an attacker could be able to issue a MitM certificate. Microsoft took action to remove trust from these roots.</p><p>MitM is a vulnerability which operating system and browser vendors need to take proactive action. There should be consideration of removing trust for all roots which have not been approved by the browser/OS trust program.</p><h2 id=livefi>Live.fi <a class=header-link href=#livefi><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" fill="currentcolor" class="bi bi-link-45deg" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path d="M4.715 6.542 3.343 7.914a3 3 0 104.243 4.243l1.828-1.829A3 3 0 008.586 5.5L8 6.086a1.001 1.001.0 00-.154.199 2 2 0 01.861 3.337L6.88 11.45A2 2 0 114.05 8.62l.793-.792a4.018 4.018.0 01-.128-1.287z"/><path d="M6.586 4.672A3 3 0 007.414 9.5l.775-.776a2 2 0 01-.896-3.346L9.12 3.55a2 2 0 012.83 2.83l-.793.792c.112.42.155.855.128 1.287l1.372-1.372a3 3 0 00-4.243-4.243L6.586 4.672z"/></svg></a></h2><p>Some hacks are better to be done more than once.

These vulnerabilities date back to the 1990s, when the US government banned selling crypto software overseas, unless it used export cipher suites which involved encryption keys no longer than 512-bits.</p><p><a href=https://casecurity.org/2015/03/11/is-your-ssl-server-vulnerable-to-a-freak-attack/>FREAK (Factoring RSA-EXPORT Keys)</a> is a vulnerability where the browser can ask to use export grade RSA in the TLS handshake. This allows a MitM attacker to intercept communications and complete the communication with export level RSA. The export level key is easy to attack, which would then allow communication to be reviewed or changed. Server administrators can mitigate FREAK by disallowing export keys on their servers.</p><p><a href=https://casecurity.org/2015/05/26/practical-steps-to-counter-the-logjam-attack/>Logjam</a> allows a MitM attacker to ask for a Diffie-Hellman prime that is less than the browser asked for. The server accommodates the falsified request and sends the 512-bit, 768-bit, 1024-bit, or whatever length prime was requested. This can allow the attacker to break the weak cryptography. Administrators should disable export cipher suites and increase the number of bits used by the prime numbers in the Diffie-Hellman key exchange to 2048 bits.</p><h2 id=http2>HTTP/2 <a class=header-link href=#http2><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" fill="currentcolor" class="bi bi-link-45deg" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path d="M4.715 6.542 3.343 7.914a3 3 0 104.243 4.243l1.828-1.829A3 3 0 008.586 5.5L8 6.086a1.001 1.001.0 00-.154.199 2 2 0 01.861 3.337L6.88 11.45A2 2 0 114.05 8.62l.793-.792a4.018 4.018.0 01-.128-1.287z"/><path d="M6.586 4.672A3 3 0 007.414 9.5l.775-.776a2 2 0 01-.896-3.346L9.12 3.55a2 2 0 012.83 2.83l-.793.792c.112.42.155.855.128 1.287l1.372-1.372a3 3 0 00-4.243-4.243L6.586 4.672z"/></svg></a></h2><p><a href=https://casecurity.org/2015/04/20/http2-is-speedy-and-secure/>HTTP/2</a>, the next version of HTTP was approved in February 2015.

This reduces time to load pages and makes better use of network resources.</p><p>Although HTTP/2 standard does not require SSL/TLS to implemented, the use of HTTP/2 will be more secure.

During certificate verification, OpenSSL will attempt to find an alternative certificate chain, if the first attempt to build a chain fails. An error in the implementation of this logic can mean that an attacker could cause certain checks on untrusted certificates to be bypassed, such as the CA flag, enabling them to use a valid leaf certificate to act as a CA and issue an invalid certificate. This means that an attacker can then become trusted the same as a certification authority (CA) and issue invalid publicly trusted SSL/TLS certificates for any domain.

This means that all new EV certificates are logged to a CT log. All old unexpired EV certificates have been whitelisted for CT in Chrome. The result is that the CT logs can now be monitored to determine which domains EV certificates have been issued for. This allows domain owners to monitor the logs to help them protect their domains.
