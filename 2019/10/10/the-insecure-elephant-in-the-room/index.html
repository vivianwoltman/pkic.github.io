And they must rely on luck to get it right.</p><p>Over 90% of data breaches start with a social engineering technique called “Phishing” — a method used by cybercriminals for stealing personal information using deceptive websites. According to Proofpoint, 99% of email threats require human interaction to execute and dangerous links outnumber malicious attachments five to one.

Every year, threat actors register millions of domains to impersonate brands and defraud those who mistakenly trust that a site is legitimate.</p><p>Unfortunately, it’s technically impossible for any security solution to protect people from every deceptive website.

On September 10th 2019, Google removed the visual indicator for website identity in Chrome. Mozilla has scheduled the removal of their website identity UI for Firefox on October 22nd 2019. I’ll explain below, the severe implications caused by this move.</p><figure><img src=/uploads/2019/10/insecure-elephant-3.png></figure><p>As you can see from my screen shot above, the domain name on the left is preceded with the company name in green. In this example, “<strong>Dropbox Inc, (US)</strong>” indicates that Dropbox had its identity verified by an independent trusted third-party called a Certificate Authority (CA). When a user clicks on the name, they would see that <a href=http://digicert.com/>DigiCert</a> was responsible for verifying their identity.</p><p>The idea was to provide online identity protection for brands while making it easy for end-users to tell the difference between the legitimate Dropbox website and a deceptive counterfeit.</p><p>Browser vendors say that “website identity is broken”. They say people don’t bother to look for identity information inside the browser. I agree with them. I agree because most people can’t tell the difference between the visual indicator that I just described, and the basic padlock.</p><p>There is a high bar for ID verification. A website owner must provide documented evidence that they are the true owner of a given organization and a given domain name.</p><p>Most people are confused between these two visual indicators because the browser UI and UX isn’t intuitive. The basic padlock is designed to tell users when their connection to a website is encrypted. A padlock doesn’t represent anything related to trust or identity. Browser designers didn’t do a good job with the design of their UI. They should have made website identity more obvious — such as a separate icon on the toolbar — making it completely separate to the padlock.</p><h2 id=why-current-security-solutions-arent-addressing-the-problem>Why current security solutions aren’t addressing the problem <a class=header-link href=#why-current-security-solutions-arent-addressing-the-problem><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" fill="currentcolor" class="bi bi-link-45deg" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path d="M4.715 6.542 3.343 7.914a3 3 0 104.243 4.243l1.828-1.829A3 3 0 008.586 5.5L8 6.086a1.001 1.001.0 00-.154.199 2 2 0 01.861 3.337L6.88 11.45A2 2 0 114.05 8.62l.793-.792a4.018 4.018.0 01-.128-1.287z"/><path d="M6.586 4.672A3 3 0 007.414 9.5l.775-.776a2 2 0 01-.896-3.346L9.12 3.55a2 2 0 012.83 2.83l-.793.792c.112.42.155.855.128 1.287l1.372-1.372A3 3 0 008.414 2.844L6.586 4.672z"/></svg></a></h2><p>According to Patrick Gelsinger, the CEO of VMware during his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-7I6cshYz4">RSA keynote in 2019</a>; “the security industry’s obsession with the threat model is broken. The ‘Known-Good’ is the way forward”.</p><p><a href=https://elie.net/talk/deconstructing-the-phishing-campaigns-that-target-gmail-users/>According to Google</a>, phishing campaigns are short lived — 7 minutes for a handcrafted campaign that targets a few dozen individuals or organizations, and 13 hours for bulk campaigns.</p><figure><img src=/uploads/2019/10/insecure-elephant-4.png></figure><p>Security solutions are reactionary. They’re designed to detect and prevent an attack from “known” threats. This means a threat must be discovered, reported, validated and classified before protection can be initiated.</p><p>New threats that are reported to companies such as Google, Microsoft and PhishTank (Cisco), take at least 2 days to validate and classify. It can sometimes take more than a week for known threats to be classified. Contrary to what some people think, no AI-based solution can automatically detect every new threat before innocent victims fall prey to an attack.

A Modlishka-based phishing scam is different and much worse. Instead of being brought to a fake website, the victim receives <strong>authentic content from the legitimate website</strong>. The reverse-proxy silently redirects all traffic and everything the user types into the legitimate site to the Modlishka server.</p><p>Credentials and sensitive information such as a password or crypto wallet address entered by the user are automatically passed on to the threat actor. The reverse proxy also asks users for 2FA tokens when prompted by the website. Attackers can then collect these 2FA tokens in real-time, to access the victims’ accounts.</p><p>When I asked Piotr if this attack can bypass any 2FA solution on the market, he said “Hi Paul, yes.

As some researchers discovered, it’s possible to cheat the system. It’s possible to setup a company called PayPal outside the US and then apply for an EV certificate for a domain that looks like paypal.com but is in fact a fake. Some CAs will catch this type of trick while some may not.</p><p>Established CAs like Entrust Datacard, Sectigo, DigiCert, GoDaddy and GlobalSign have robust processes for certificate revocation. As soon as an attacker has had their EV certificate revoked, they can never buy another one using the same company. So all of that time, cost and effort to setup a real company can only be used once. Even if you put the cost of verification aside, this is an extraordinary high bar for criminals.</p><p>Of the thousands of domains classified as Phishing, Malware or Cryptojacking by MetaCert in the past 3 months, not one of them had an EV certificate. In fact, I spent a considerable effort researching malicious websites that used an EV certificate for this article. In all my research, I was unable to find a single instance of a malicious website that used an EV certificate.

We built a browser add-on for Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Brave. We told users to ignore the browser padlock and instead, rely on MetaCert’s shield, which we added to their browser toolbar. As you know, no matter where you open a link on a computer, it will always open inside your default browser, so we felt this was the best place to provide ultimate protection.</p><p>We considered our software as a security solution with built-in anti-phishing awareness. Most end-users didn’t realize it protected them from known malicious websites — so to them it was a personal firewall that made it easy to make better-informed choices about what and who to trust.</p><p>We classified as many crypto related websites and social media accounts as we could with our URL-based threat intelligence system as “Verified as Safe”.

Some website owners sought verification before being prompted by their users. We took great pride from the fact that even companies like <a href=https://metamask.io/>MetaMask</a>, who had their own anti-phishing security built into their browser add-on, sought the verification of their domain names from MetaCert.

Ellis was the head of marketing at LogMeIn and Uproar from launch to IPO. He was the first marketer at Dropbox, Lookout and Xobni, and he coined the term “growth hacker” in 2010. So, he knows a thing or two when it comes to product/market fit research.</p><p>Our goal for the survey was to get feedback from people who had recently experienced “real usage” of the product. The key question in the survey for these people according to Ellis, is:</p><p>“How would you feel if you could no longer rely on MetaCert’s green shield?</p><ol><li>Very disappointed</li><li>Somewhat disappointed</li><li>Not disappointed</li><li>N/A I no longer use MetaCert</li></ol><p>According to Ellis, to get an indication of product/market fit, you’ll want to know the percentage of people who would be “very disappointed” if they could no longer use your product. In his experience, it becomes possible to sustainably grow a product when it reaches around 40% of users who try it that would be “very disappointed” if they could no longer use it.</p><p>For this percentage to be meaningful, we needed to have a fairly large sample size. In Ellis’ experience, a minimum of 30 responses is needed before the survey becomes directionally useful. At 100+ responses he is much more confident in the results.</p><p>When pushing an update for a browser add-on to end-users, you submit it to the browser store — the store automatically updates every user to the latest version, silently in the background.</p><p>We took advantage of the silent update capability. 85k users were prompted with a banner at the top of their browser. There was no way for them to stop it from appearing. And they were unable to close the banner until they clicked on one of the answers to Ellis’ question. We asked “How disappointed would you be if you could no longer rely on the Green Shield?”. Given that some users would have been upset by this interrupted experience with our forced question, we didn’t know what to expect. We did see a small spike in the number of uninstalls that day, so we did pay a small price for this research.</p><p>The results came in. <strong>63% of the users said they would be very disappointed if they could no longer rely on the Green Shield</strong>. Over <strong>5,000</strong> users went on to complete the survey with 20 questions. This is the highest number we have come across so far.
