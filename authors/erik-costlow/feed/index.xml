These posts covered the role of code signatures as a “digital shrinkwrap” designed to answer a simple question: Did the software I am about to run actually come from the author or has someone changed it along the way?
As software is downloaded, assembled, copied, distributed and redistributed, it can be modified at any point along the supply chain.</description></item></channel></rss>
