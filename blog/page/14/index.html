<a href=https://pkic.org/tags/revocation/ class="badge bg-secondary">Revocation</a></small><br>OCSP Stapling OCSP is a protocol used to check the validity of certificates to make sure they have not been revoked. OCSP is an alternative to Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs). Since OCSP responses can be as small as a few hundred bytes, OCSP is particularly useful when the issuing CA has relatively big CRLs, as well as when the client has limited memory and processing power.
OCSP can also provide much more timely information than CRLs about the status of a certificate since the information is generally fetched more frequently.</p><p><strong><a href=https://pkic.org/2013/04/17/recap-of-nists-workshop-on-improving-trust-in-the-online-marketplace/>Recap of NIST’s Workshop on Improving Trust in the Online Marketplace</a></strong><br><small class=text-secondary>April 17, 2013 by

<a href=https://pkic.org/tags/nist/ class="badge bg-secondary">NIST</a></small><br>On April 10 and 11, NIST held a workshop in Maryland to bring together many parties (industry, research and academia communities, and government sectors) to examine “technical and administrative efforts to increase trust online by improving the Public Key Infrastructure certificate marketplace supporting SSL and TLS.”
From the opening keynote to the final remarks, we heard from experts around the world. There were presentations on the current state of trust infrastructure and audits, the impact of recent breaches, detailed looks on some emerging solutions like Certificate Transparency and DANE, and new ideas to manage and minimize risk in key usage.</p><p><strong><a href=https://pkic.org/2013/04/10/casc-happenings-at-nist/>CASC Happenings at NIST</a></strong><br><small class=text-secondary>April 10, 2013 by

(<a href=https://www.entrust.com/ title="Entrust is dedicated to securing identities, data, and transactions around the globe" target=_blank>Entrust</a>)</small><br>We’ve heard the argument that website operators could just use self-signed certificates. They are easy to issue and they are “free.” Before issuing self-signed certificates, it’s a good idea to examine the trust and security model. You should also compare self-signed certificates to the publicly trusted certification authority (CA) model; and then make your own decision.
Self-Signed Certificate Model Owner says who they are Owner issues on their own policy Owner is responsible for quality Owner may not follow industry guidelines Owner may not provide certificate status Compromised certificates may not be able to be revoked Owner is not audited Issuer of certificate may not be authorized by the domain owner Certificates may not be renewed if there are no reminders Self-signed certificate model does not provide trust and the browser provides a trust dialogue box to indicate such Publicly-Trusted CA-Signed Certificate Model CA verifies the owner of the domain and the certificate applicant CA operates to a policy in conformance with the requirements of the browser and operating system vendors.</p><p><strong><a href=https://pkic.org/2013/03/22/what-the-icann-ssac-report-doesnt-tell-you/>What the ICANN SSAC Report Doesn’t Tell You</a></strong><br><small class=text-secondary>March 22, 2013 by

<a href=https://pkic.org/tags/rc4/ class="badge bg-secondary">RC4</a></small><br>The latest published attacks target specific algorithms used within SSL/TLS. Those algorithms are used when a client connects to a server via SSL/TLS; they’re not used when a Certificate Authority signs a certificate. The attacks demonstrate potential weaknesses in the use of the algorithms.
While interesting, the attacks don’t represent an immediate practical threat to users of SSL/TLS (including online banking, e-commerce, social networking, etc.). Such attacks require an attacker to run malicious software on a user’s computer which would connect to a particular web site and send the same message over and over again many times.</p><p><strong><a href=https://pkic.org/2013/03/11/the-importance-of-revocation-checking-part-2-a-real-world-example/>The Importance of Revocation Checking Part 2: A Real World Example</a></strong><br><small class=text-secondary>March 11, 2013 by
Wayne Thayer</small><br>Just last week, a new security incident related to certificate revocation checking made headlines. It was discovered that a legitimate website was hosting a malicious Java application that installed malware on the computers of people who visited the site. This comes after recent updates that introduced Security Level settings in Java, and then raised the default from Medium to High. At the high level, users are shown a warning before any unsigned Java code is executed.</p><p><strong><a href=https://pkic.org/2013/03/09/the-importance-of-checking-for-certificate-revocation/>The Importance of Checking for Certificate Revocation</a></strong><br><small class=text-secondary>March 9, 2013 by
Rick Andrews</small><br>Certificates are typically valid for one to three years, and during that time it’s possible that the web site owner or the CA realizes that end users should not trust the certificate. There are several cases in which this might happen, including these:
The web site owner ceases doing business, no longer owns the domain name used in the certificate, has changed their organization name, or wishes to shut down the web server.</p><p><strong><a href=https://pkic.org/2013/03/08/rsa-recap-securing-your-site/>RSA Recap – Securing Your Site</a></strong><br><small class=text-secondary>March 8, 2013 by

<a href=https://pkic.org/tags/rsa/ class="badge bg-secondary">RSA</a></small><br>At RSA last week a few of us participated in panel discussions that focused on SSL/TLS. During the panel that I moderated on Friday, one theme we addressed was secure server configuration. One of CASC’s goals is to help harden existing SSL/TLS implementations against vulnerabilities—because most SSL/TLS exploits arise from suboptimal website configurations. These vulnerabilities and attacks can be mitigated or even eliminated with proper server configuration and good website design.</p><div class="pagination justify-content-center mt-5"><ul class=pagination><li class=page-item><a href=/blog/ class=page-link aria-label=First><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;&#171;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/blog/page/13/ class=page-link aria-label=Previous><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/blog/>1</a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/blog/page/2/>2</a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/blog/page/3/>3</a></li><li class="page-item disabled"><span aria-hidden=true>&nbsp;&mldr;&nbsp;</span></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/blog/page/13/>13</a></li><li class="page-item active"><a class=page-link href=/blog/page/14/>14</a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/blog/page/15/>15</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/blog/page/15/ class=page-link aria-label=Next><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/blog/page/15/ class=page-link aria-label=Last><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;&#187;</span></a></li></ul></div></div></div></main><div id=members class=container><div class="row py-5 justify-content-center text-center"><div class="col py-4 px-5"><a href=/members/firmaprofesional/ title="Firmaprofesional, We innovate to create secure and efficient transaction environments -
