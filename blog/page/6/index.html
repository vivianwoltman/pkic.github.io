What will happen?
Will all websites using SHA-1 fail? No. SHA-1 will be supported by browsers and operating systems through 2016. Microsoft and Mozilla have announced that Windows and Firefox will not support SHA-1 in 2017, but no change for 2016. We expect Apple to follow the same protocol.
What about Chrome? Chrome will still provide warning indications in the browser status bar for SHA-1 signed certificates which expire in 2016 and in 2017 or later.</p><p><strong><a href=https://pkic.org/2015/12/14/2016-looking-back-moving-forward/>2016 – Looking Back, Moving Forward</a></strong><br><small class=text-secondary>December 14, 2015 by

Vendors found new and creative ways to provide vulnerabilities including the now popular man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. MitM as well as a host of other new vulnerabilities caused browsers to rethink their security requirements. This article gives a flashback of the exploits and industry changes from 2015 and looks ahead at the latest security requirements and how it impacts IT security teams.</p><p><strong><a href=https://pkic.org/2015/11/30/code-signing-baseline-requirements/>Code Signing Baseline Requirements</a></strong><br><small class=text-secondary>November 30, 2015 by
CA Security Council</small><br>You may have heard that the CA/Browser Forum is getting ready to approve Baseline Requirements for Code Signing certificates. But why is this important?
Let’s back up and get some background on code signing. Software code that is digitally signed indicates to the user that the code has not been tampered with since it was signed. It also provides authenticity as to who signed it and when. With the advent of malware, it’s important to insure that the code which was written by the developer is the same code which you downloaded and installed into your computer or mobile phone.</p><p><strong><a href=https://pkic.org/2015/11/10/ca/b-forum-istanbul-2015/>CA/B Forum Istanbul 2015</a></strong><br><small class=text-secondary>November 10, 2015 by
Dean Coclin</small><br>While some face to face meetings can be rather mundane and boring, that can’t be said about October’s CA/B Forum meeting in Istanbul, Turkey. Guest speaker Andrea Servida from the European Commission gave an overview of the new eIDAS regulation on electronic identification and trust services. While not everyone in the room agreed with his points, all were made aware that this has now become the law in the EU and certificate authorities which plan to issue the new EU Qualified website certificates must comply with it.</p><p><strong><a href=https://pkic.org/2015/10/21/how-safe-are-your-business-online-payments-e-commerce-sites-and-protected-payment-gateways/>How Safe Are Your Business’ Online Payments?: E-Commerce Sites and Protected Payment Gateways</a></strong><br><small class=text-secondary>October 21, 2015 by

Online payments can be made in a variety of ways, but majority of the online financial transactions are done through secured payment gateways. Secure payment gateways, as the name suggests, are application service providers for ecommerce websites that authorize various financial transactions taking place on online stores for ensuring safety for both the retailers and the online buyers. The key goal of payment gateways is to secure personal information like cconsumers’ credit card numbers by encrypting their personal and confidential information.</p><p><strong><a href=https://pkic.org/2015/08/27/what-are-application-reputation-and-publisher-reputation/>What Are “Application Reputation” and “Publisher Reputation”?</a></strong><br><small class=text-secondary>August 27, 2015 by
Ben Wilson</small><br>As one dog says to the other in Peter Steiner’s classic New Yorker cartoon– “On the Internet, nobody knows you’re a dog.”
Software downloaded from the Internet is similar to people on the Internet–it is hard to tell which ones are dogs–without help, which is what “application reputation” technology provides. “Application reputation” and “publisher reputation” are methods employed by Microsoft’s SmartScreen and other systems to distinguish good software from bad software as it is downloaded from the Internet.</p><p><strong><a href=https://pkic.org/2015/07/10/openssl-high-severity-vulnerability/>OpenSSL High Severity Vulnerability</a></strong><br><small class=text-secondary>July 10, 2015 by

(<a href=https://www.entrust.com/ title="Entrust is dedicated to securing identities, data, and transactions around the globe" target=_blank>Entrust</a>)</small><br>OpenSSL has announced a high severity vulnerability, CVE-2015-1793 which will require an upgrade to some OpenSSL installations.
The vulnerability was discovered by Google personnel Adam Langley and David Benjamin on June 24, 2015. Google has been working on an alternative to OpenSSL called BoringSSL. This has allowed Google to reduce vulnerabilities in their installations, but is also a benefit to OpenSSL as issues have been reported. Note that BoringSSL is not impacted.</p><p><strong><a href=https://pkic.org/2015/06/24/new-directions-for-elliptic-curve-cryptography-in-internet-protocols/>New Directions for Elliptic Curve Cryptography in Internet Protocols</a></strong><br><small class=text-secondary>June 24, 2015 by
Rick Andrews</small><br>Last week I attended and presented at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Workshop on Elliptic Curve Cryptography Standards. In NIST’s words, “The workshop is to provide a venue to engage the crypto community, including academia, industry, and government users to discuss possible approaches to promote the adoption of secure, interoperable and efficient elliptic curve mechanisms.”
We began by discussing the reasons for holding this workshop. Speakers acknowledged that although there are no known issues with the current set of NIST curves, in some circles they are widely distrusted.</p><p><strong><a href=https://pkic.org/2015/06/11/the-insecurity-of-mobile-applications/>The Insecurity of Mobile Applications</a></strong><br><small class=text-secondary>June 11, 2015 by
Rick Andrews</small><br>Recently, we read about lots of SSL/TLS-related vulnerabilities found in mobile apps, which should come as no surprise. We were warned about this back in 2012 (see these studies). More warnings came in 2014 from CERT and FireEye. The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) listed “insufficient transport layer protection” as number three (#3) in its top 10 list of mobile security problems of 2014. Apps that don’t use SSL/TLS are particularly vulnerable, given the ease of reading and modifying unsecured traffic at Wi-Fi hot spots, for example.</p><p><strong><a href=https://pkic.org/2015/06/08/facebook-will-stop-supporting-sha-1-in-october/>Facebook Will Stop Supporting SHA-1 in October</a></strong><br><small class=text-secondary>June 8, 2015 by
Ben Wilson</small><br>On June 2, 2015, Facebook announced that it would stop supporting Facebook-connected apps that were signed with SHA-1, as of October 1, 2015.
“These changes are part of a broader shift in how browsers and web sites encrypt traffic to protect the contents of online communications. Typically, web browsers use a hash function to create a unique fingerprint for a chunk of data or a message. This fingerprint is then digitally signed to prove that a message has not been altered or tampered with when passing through the various servers and systems between your computer and Facebook’s servers.</p><div class="pagination justify-content-center mt-5"><ul class=pagination><li class=page-item><a href=/blog/ class=page-link aria-label=First><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;&#171;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/blog/page/5/ class=page-link aria-label=Previous><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/blog/>1</a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/blog/page/2/>2</a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/blog/page/3/>3</a></li><li class="page-item disabled"><span aria-hidden=true>&nbsp;&mldr;&nbsp;</span></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/blog/page/5/>5</a></li><li class="page-item active"><a class=page-link href=/blog/page/6/>6</a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/blog/page/7/>7</a></li><li class="page-item disabled"><span aria-hidden=true>&nbsp;&mldr;&nbsp;</span></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/blog/page/15/>15</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/blog/page/7/ class=page-link aria-label=Next><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/blog/page/15/ class=page-link aria-label=Last><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;&#187;</span></a></li></ul></div></div></div></main><div id=members class=container><div class="row py-5 justify-content-center text-center"><div class="col py-4 px-5"><a href=/members/dtrust/ title="D-Trust, Paving the way for social and economic progress -
